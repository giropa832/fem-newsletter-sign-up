## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Rails 8
- Turbo
- Stimulus

### What I learned

This was my first project using Rails 8, Turbo, and Stimulus. Despite how simple the project seemed, it enabled me to learn the basics of Rails 8 from the ground up to deployment on my own server. Dealing with Turbo and Stimulus was very challeging, since I'd never used them before. Getting accustomed to the changes in Rails over the years was also difficult but I am very happy with the results. 

### Continued development

I must keep reading the documentation and keep practicing with Rails 8, Turbo, and Stimulus. I'd like to include some more complex features in the future, such as authentication and authorization, as well as ActionMailer.
